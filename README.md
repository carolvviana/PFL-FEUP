## Description of the game

Six MaKING is a game for 2 players, played on a 5x5 board. 

Each player owns 16 disks and alternate turns playing. When it is your turn you can:

 1. place a new disk on the board (**Pawn**) on any empty square
 2. move a tower (or part of one) to a non-empty square
       <br>a. **Move 1 piece of the tower** (**Pawn**): moves a single square in all 4 directions (up, down, right, left) on top of another tower.
       <br>b. **Move 2 pieces of the tower** (**Rook**): moves any number of squares in all 4 directions until the first tower in its path.
       <br>c. **Move 3 pieces of the tower** (**Knight**): moves in L shape on top of another tower.
       <br>d. **Move 4 pieces of the tower** (**Bishop**): moves any number of squares diagonally until the first tower in its path.
       <br>e. **Move 5 pieces of the tower** (**Queen**): moves any number of squares
       in all 8 directions until the first tower in its path.
 
If you only move a part of a tower, the disks move as the original tower, before being split.

You cannot undo the opponents move.

The game ends when the first tower consisting of six or more disks (King) is built. The player who has its color on top is the winner. There are no draws in this game.
